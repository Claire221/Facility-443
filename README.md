# Facility 443

## Site Overview
    
   Facility 443 is a fully immersive choose your own adventure horror game. 
    You wake up in a room you don’t recognize daze and confused and its your choices that will determine if you get out alive or not. While you explore the environment you can pick up items that will help you determine what’s going on and help you break out of the facility. 
    Do you focus on getting answers and figuring out what’s going on or do you get out as fast as possible? With danger behind every corner, footsteps chasing you and a menacing voice counting down to an event that you’re not sure you want to stick around to see one wrong decision could end it all. 


## UX

For the design of the game I wanted it to stick to the horror theme of the game, I wanted each state of the game to have an image representing the setting that the story is describing so that the player can fully immerse themselves in the experience and picture themselves in the scene. I want the images to have lots of dark patches such as a partially open doorway on a dark corridor to give the feeling that anything could come from any direction at any time. 
For the text and buttons Im keeping them simple so they don’t distract from the story imagery. 

### User Stories
 
- As a user I want a game that is easy to pick up and play
- As a user I want the UI to be simple and intuitive, so I don’t need instructions on how to play
- As a user I want to be scared or creeped out
- As a user I want the storyline to be easy to follow and understand
- As a user I want the decisions I can make to be easily understandable


### Colour Scheme

 Because the game is a horror game I wanted to stick to that theme for the colour scheme, so use a lot of dark colours. For the text I want to keep the colours simple so they don’t distract from the imagery on the screen. For the story text I used a white colour so it stands out from the background and is easy to read and for the buttons I used the same blue colour that’s in the loading screen. 


### Typography
    
For the Typography I wanted to play on the facility side of the game, so I focused on finding something with clean lines that looked clinical. 

### Wireframes

My first step for this project was to sketch out a basic plan for what I wanted the game screen to look like. I decided to use Balsamiq to create some rough wireframes so that I could refer back to them throughout the design process.
