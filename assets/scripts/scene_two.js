                                some of them are needle marks. The last and most peculiar thing about her is she has glowing blue eyes, you would thing they would scare you but they dont. Instead you

                                bad people? I dont remember anything' You reply, getting slightly frustrated. You need to get out of here and if this woman doesnt explain things faster your going to get caught

                                the floor. <br> 'Found us where? what do you mean we go against nature?' You ask her, subconsciously you have reached out and grasped the womans forearm you slightly shake it out of

                                just havent admitted it to yourself yet <br>  'No, this isnt out home.. Well maybe for some of us who might have grown up here, but for the rest of us we were stolen. \n The people from this

                                <br> She lets out a small laugh as she says the last sentence but you hardly notice, you can hardly hear anything except the blood rushing to your ears. How can it be? You were stollen? Why cant

                                and you straighten in shock. The side of her head just above her ear a small patch of her hair is completely shaved, you hadnt noticed it before because the hair on top is long enough to 
                                cover it. You lean forward slightly to have a better look and see that there is a small pink scar running through the centre of the patch. <br> 'This is why you dont remember who you are 
                                and this is why you can understand them' As shes talking she lets go of her hair and it covers the patch back up so you would never know its there`,

                                `She turns and looks at you <br> 'Its some kind of chip, they realised that we couldnt communicate with them so they implanted one of these in us all so they could give us instructions better, its faster than trying to teach us new languages
                                they can program it to any language and poof were fluent. They also use them to control us, there is a small wire that runs from the chip directly into out brain so if we misbehave they can give us a quick
                                zap to get us back inline' The woman explains this very calmly like the revelation isnt completely making your world implode. \<br> You lift your hand up to the side of your head, your almost to scared to check
                                but as you run your fingers over the spot just above your ear you feel the scar <br> 'Yep, and you must have really pissed someone off to get fried this bad, but dont worry everything will come back in a few days
                                its never permanent. <br> Your just about to as her more questions when you hear the door handle turn. You look at the Woman in horror, her expression mirrors yours 'Hide' she whispers <br> Where do you hide?`

                                help?.. but you dont know where you are.. maybe find a computer then? You could then find out where you are.. As your planning your next moves you realise that you can hear a noise 
                                in the distance. <br> You freeze and ice runs down your spine as you realise that you can hear people and they are heading in this direction. Throwing your plan out the window you 
                                take off down the corridor at a full sprint, you come to a corner and skid round it and bump into something solid. You fall back and land on your back, the impact taking the wind 
                                out of you. <br>Dazed you look up and see two people in lab coats staring down at you 'Hey watchâ€¦'They start to say but then shock takes over their face as they realize that they didnt 
                                bump into another lab coat person 'Hey what are you doing!' They shout as you quickly scramble to get your arms and legs under you so you can stand up and run in the opposite direction
                                only to be confronted by another group of people who are stood in the corridor talking amongst themselves. <br> They are wearing what looks to be military uniforms at the sound of your 
                                approaching steps one of them has turned in your direction 'Hey!' They shout and raise their weapon in your direction.. This alerts the others to your presents and they quickly follow 
                                suit filling the corridor with the sounds of weapons being pointed in your direction. Not hanging around you turn back around to face the lab coats again figuring you have a better chance

                                caring if your hurting yourself in the process you just want to get free because you know if they send you back to that room you might never get out.<br> You can hear a commotion behind
                                you but your too focused on trying to get away to listen to what theyre saying.. Your struggling with all your might, you use your other hand to try and pry the lab coats fingers from your 
                                arm but their grip is like steel.. You feel a sharp prick in your neck and you whip
                                your head around and realise that while you were busy trying to get away it gave the other lab coat person the opportunity to come behind you and inject you with something.. Your not sure
                                what it was but it acts fast, the corridor begins to spin and the lab coats faces start to swirl and blur and before you know it all you see is darkness..`;
