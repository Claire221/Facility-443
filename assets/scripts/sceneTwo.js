                                because she's sitting down. Her skin is pale and she has bruises and marks all over her arms, you have to swallow down the bile rising up your throat as you realise that \
                                some of them are needle marks. The last and most peculiar thing about her is she has glowing blue eyes, you would thing they would scare you but they dont. Instead you \

                                do you know where we are? what are we doing here?' you say and gesture are the room \n\n 'Were bad people' the woman replies, her voice shaking slightly \n\n 'What do you mean \
                                bad people? I dont remember anything' You reply, getting slightly frustrated. You need to get out of here and if this woman doesnt explain things faster your going to get caught \
                                \n\n  'They found us and brought us here, they say were wrong.. that we should exist. We go against nature' \n\n go against nature? what does she mean? you try to remember anything \
                                from before you woke up but you instantly get that pain in the side of you head again. Your knees buckle and you have to hold onto the side of the bed to stop yourself from hitting \
                                the floor. \n\n 'Found us where? what do you mean we go against nature?' You ask her, subconsciously you have reached out and grasped the womans forearm you slightly shake it out of \

                                just havent admitted it to yourself yet \n 'No, this isnt out home.. Well maybe for some of us who might have grown up here, but for the rest of us we were stolen. The people from this \
                                planet arrived at ours in a space ship, they came with their guns and their explosions when we fought back and they realized what we can do they stole us away. Said that they couldnâ€™t leave \
                                a weapon like that behind, think of how they can use us. So they brought us here, they are trying to replicate the gene that gives us our gifts to use on their people. Not having much luck though\
                                /n/n She lets out a small laugh as she says the last sentence but you hardly notice, you can hardly hear anything except the blood rushing to your ears. How can it be? You were stollen? Why cant \
                                you remember that? and how can you be from another planet when you've recognized the words the people here are saying? ",

                                "'Why dont I remember any of that? and how come I can understand what theyre saying when I hear them in the corridor?' /n/n She doesnt say anything but she turns her head to the side \
                                and you straighten in shock. The side of her head just above her ear a small patch of her hair is completely shaved, you hadnt noticed it before because the hair on top is long enough to \
                                cover it. You lean forward slightly to have a better look and see that there is a small pink scar running through the centre of the patch. \n\n 'This is why you dont remember who you are \
                                and this is why you can understand them' As shes talking she lets go of her hair and it covers the patch back up so you would never know its there",

                                "She turns and looks at you \n\n 'Its some kind of chip, they realised that we couldnt communicate with them so they implanted one of these in us all so they could give us instructions better, its faster than trying to teach us new languages \
                                they can program it to any language and poof were fluent. They also use them to control us, there is a small wire that runs from the chip directly into out brain so if we misbehave they can give us a quick \
                                zap to get us back inline' The woman explains this very calmly like the revelation isnt completely making your world implode. \n\n You lift your hand up to the side of your head, your almost to scared to check \
                                but as you run your fingers over the spot just above your ear you feel the scar \n\n 'Yep, and you must have really pissed someone off to get fried this bad, but dont worry everything will come back in a few days\
                                its never permanent. \n\n Your just about to as her more questions when you hear the door handle turn. You look at the Woman in horror, her expression mirrors yours 'Hide' she whispers \n\n Where do you hide?"
