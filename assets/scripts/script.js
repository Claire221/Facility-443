                        with some mould growing in the cracks, taking in a deep breath your nostrils fill with an antiseptic smell \
                        and your head begins to thud. After waiting a minute for your head to clear you sit up and get a clear view \
                        of the room your in. Your in one of two single size beds, the other is empty but the covers arenâ€™t made, has \
                        someone been there recently? Looking around the room you see the walls and floor match the tiles of the ceiling \
                        giving the room a sterile feel. In the middle of the wall opposite you is a solid metal door. Turning to your left \
                        you see a counter with a sink and to the right a wardrobe is tucked away in the corner. You try to stand but you \
                        realise that your arms are tied to either side of the bed by thick leather straps, your can feel your heartbeat \
                        speed up in your chest and you start to find it hard to catch your breath and a feeling of dread has settled in your stomach, \
                        you notice there is a small metal trolly next to the bed on it there is a small pad of paper, a pen, a scaple and a pair of tweezers \
                        \n\nWhat do you do?"
