# Testing

## Browser Compatibility

I tested my game against the top 3 web browsers - Google chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. I started by testing that the game loaded as expected, that all the images and styles work displaying correctly. I then went into the devtools and changed the responsive dimensions to test how the game looked for different screen sizes. 

| Browser        | Screen Size | Image                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chrome         | Desktop     |![Chrome Desktop](/documentation/testing/chrome-desktop.jpg) |
| Firefox        | Desktop     |![Firefox Desktop](/documentation/testing/chrome-desktop.jpg)|
| Microsoft Edge | Desktop     ||

## Code Validation

### HTML testing

Once I had finished my game I ran my code through a HTML validator to ensure that it was correct.

### CSS testing

Once I had finished my game I ran my CSS code through a CSS validator to ensure that it was correct. When I first ran my code through the validator my code failed because I had an error with one of my positioning styles.

I then fixed the issue and re ran my code through the validator to make sure that it was all correct.

### JavaScript testing

Once I had finished my game I ran each of my JavaScript script files through a JavaScript validator to ensure that it was correct.

#### Scene Two
#### Scene Three


## User Story Testing
- As a user I want the UI to be simple and intuitive, so I donâ€™t need instructions on how to play

- As a user I want to be scared or creeped out

## Unfixed Bugs
list out any unfinished bugs you might have, where applicable... if none, don't just put "I have no bugs"... put something like: "There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of."
